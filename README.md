This system will enable users to properly budget their income using the envelope system.

How Envelope Budgeting Works

The envelope budgeting system divides your income into different spending categoriesâ€”bills, groceries, gas, and so on. Once you've decided how much you should spend on each category, you'll take that amount in cash and place it into an envelope. Then, only spend what's available in that envelope for that category's bills or purchases. The aim is to prevent you from overspending by limiting what is available to spend.

Even if you no longer use cash to pay bills, the principle still works and can be applied using software or other financial technology.

The strength of envelope budgeting is that it forces you to stay in touch with spending habits because once the envelope is empty, you can't spend from that category until the next paycheck replenishes the envelope.

Step 1. Establish Categories and Limits
To use envelope budgeting, first establish spending categories for your budget and then set spending limits for the categories.

To understand what categories might be useful for your budget, consider where your money goes. Try to list your common expenditures so you can group them effectively. For example, your categories may include:

Groceries
Gas
Health and grooming
Clothing
Dining out
Household items
Pet care
Children's items
Tailor your categories to your specific situation. Make as many categories as you need, but not so many as to be overwhelming.

Don't forget to include irregular expenses, such as taxes, insurance, or gifts, and a savings category.

To discover what a reasonable monthly limit might be for each category, check your recent banking statements or receipts to get an idea of your usual costs. You can use that number or, if you're trying to cut back, use a slightly smaller figure.

Step 2. Label Each Envelope
Using one envelope per spending category, write the name of each category and the monthly budgeted amount on the envelopes.

If you are paid weekly or bimonthly, divide the total monthly amount for each category by the number of pay periods you have in each month and record that figure on the envelope as well. That will help you put the right amount from each paycheck into the envelope.

Step 3. Separate Funds
For this example, assume you receive a paycheck for $500. Cash your paycheck and put the allocated amount for each budgeted category into the respective envelope. A simple example might be divided like so:

$100 in the grocery budget envelope
$200 in the rent budget envelope
$70 in the gas and auto maintenance budget envelope
$30 in the utility budget envelope
$70 in the personal care and clothing envelope
$30 in the savings budget envelope
Each time you are paid, add that check's earnings to each cash envelope according to your established budget.

Step 4. Spend From the Envelopes
When you go shopping or pay a bill, take the money for the payment from the appropriate envelope. If you are paying a bill in person, carry the envelope with you. Likewise, if you are going grocery shopping, bring your grocery envelope.
